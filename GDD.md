## Introduction

Run Charlie is endless runner game built in JavaScript with the Phaser Library as the capstone for Microverse. I have made use of the assets to relate with the story and coded then necessary logic.

## Story

Charlie, the bunny is inspired after watching Forrest Gump. Now he's on his own mission to run and live his life to the fullest, because that's what bunnies do right?

On his path to greatness lies evil bats who have vowed to stop his run. But Charlie can hop thrice and evade them and continue on his journey of running and eating his favorite carrots!

Will you help him complete this run?

All you need to do is Tap that mouse key to jump across platforms and evade obstacles.

In one go, Charlie can jump 3 times before touching the platform again!

Let's see how far you can take Charlie on his journey!
